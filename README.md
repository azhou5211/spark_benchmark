# Spark Benchmark

By: Andrew Zhou

In this project, I will be benchmarking Azure and AWS spark sessions using a self-implemented version of K-means algorithm. The running times can be found [here](https://github.com/azhou5211/spark_benchmark/blob/main/src/data/Running_time.xls). My analysis of the running time was perform in this [notebook](https://github.com/azhou5211/spark_benchmark/blob/main/src/notebooks/analysis.ipynb).

Final report can be found [here](https://github.com/azhou5211/spark_benchmark/blob/main/docs/final.pdf).
